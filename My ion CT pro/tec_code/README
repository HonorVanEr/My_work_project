This directory contains all of the .m and .c files needed to run the main matlab program get_tec.m

This directory also contains sample files:

driver.template - program driver file
nas01310.09o - rinex file
CODG1310.09I - ionex file
igs15311.sp3 - orbit file
epgga9.131 - ephemerides file

these will allow you to run the program for the settings in driver.template and output example TEC timeseries.

get_tec.m outputs .mat files by receiver, satellite, or both (options in driver file).  Each .mat file is a 1x1 structure containing, for each satellite/receiver pair, a 13xN matrix whose contents are listed in the header of the get_tec.m program.

To start, put all of the files contained in the .zip archive into a directory

before you run get_tec you must compile readrinex.c in matlab: 'mex readrinex.c'

to start the run, type (in matlab): get_tec('driver.template')

futher details of the program can be found in tec_docu.pdf
